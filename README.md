# Data-Science

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey in learning Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository serves as a record of my progress, insights gained, and projects undertaken as I delve into these exciting fields.

In this repository, you will find a collection of notebooks, code snippets, and projects covering various aspects of Python programming, EDA techniques, ML algorithms, and NLP applications.
